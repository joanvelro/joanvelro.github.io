abstract: "This study assessed whether bilingual memory is susceptible to
the extreme processing demands of professional simultaneous
interpreters (PSIs). Seventeen PSIs and 17 non-interpreter
bilinguals completed word production, lexical retrieval, and
verbal fluency tasks. PSIs exhibited enhanced fluency in their
two languages, and they were faster to translate words in both
directions. However, no significant differences emerged in
picture naming or word reading. This suggests that lexical
enhancements in PSIs are confined to their specifically trained
abilities (vocabulary search, interlingual reformulation), with
no concomitant changes in other word-processing mechanisms.
Importantly, these differences seem to reflect specifically
linguistic effects, as both samples were matched for relevant
executive skills. Moreover, only word translation performance
correlated with the PSIs’ years of interpreting experience.
Therefore, despite their tight cooperation, different
subcomponents within bilingual memory seem characterized by
independent, usage-driven flexibility"
