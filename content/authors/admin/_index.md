Iâ€™m a PhD student at the Neuroscience Department of the Max-Planck-Institute AE 
in Frankfurt, Germany.

My current work focuses on understanding how the brain represents abstract knowledge,
and how it uses this type of information to make predictions about future events. 
More broadly, I'm interested in the development of computational methods that probe 
the format and structure of neural representations.

I love programming, and I believe that research software development is an integral 
part of science. In my free time I like contributing to open-source projects related 
to data-science, and mentor first-time contributors that belong to underrepresented 
groups in technology.
