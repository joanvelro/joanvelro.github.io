title: "Investigating the content and representational format of information in higher-level areas"
summary: "What features of our everyday experiences are high-level brain areas processing? How do they represent, store or retrieve abstract information? How much and in what ways do they depend on the processes taking place lower in the hierarchy?"

Our brain seems to function in a hierarchical fashion, with lower-regions processing fine-grained details of our environment and higher-level regions encoding more abstract content. But many different regions in the brain are considered “high-level” (e.g. all those belonging to the default mode network). What features of our everyday experiences is each of these processing? How do they represent, store or retrieve this abstract information? How much and in what ways do they depend on the processes taking place lower in the hierarchy? Our work addresses these questions using a combination of neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG and ECoG), visual narrative data and MVPA approaches.
