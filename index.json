For that promise to bear out, we argue that current proposals resting on the active inference scheme need refinement to become a process theory of consciousness. One way of improving a theory in mechanistic terms is to use formalisms such as computational models that implement, attune and validate the conceptual notions put forward. Here, we examine how computational modelling approaches have been used to refine the theoretical proposals linking active inference and consciousness, with a focus on the extent and success to which they have been developed to accommodate different facets of consciousness and experimental paradigms, as well as how simulations and empirical data have been used to test and improve these computational models. While current attempts using this approach have shown promising results, we argue they remain preliminary in nature. To refine their predictive and structural validity, testing those models against empirical data is needed i.e., new and unobserved neural data. A remaining challenge for active inference to become a theory of consciousness is to generalize the model to accommodate the broad range of consciousness explananda; and in particular to account for the phenomenological aspects of experience. Notwithstanding these gaps, this approach has proven to be a valuable avenue for theory advancement and holds great potential for future research.","tags":[],"title":"Active Inference as a Computational Framework for Consciousness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martina G.

A growing concern — both in the research fields of cognitive neuroscience and deep learning— is whether findings can be reproduced using identical or similar models and datasets, as should be expected. However, each domain has its own research objectives and aims to reproduce patterns relating to distinct types of scientific claims. Cognitive computational neuroscience makes claims about human cognitive and neural processing, while deep learning research focuses on the performance of artificial neural networks. The issues around the reproducibility of these claims thus need to be tackled in idiosyncratic ways.\nIn this talk, I will describe these issues in detail, and outline existing tools for ensuring reproducibility at the intersection of deep learning and cognitive neuroscience.","tags":[],"title":"Reproducibility of deep learning models in cognitive computational neuroscience","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Martina G.

Accruing research indicates that behavioral advantages in this population are restricted to those skills that are directly taxed during professional practice (e.g., translation as opposed to reading), but little is known about the neural signatures of such selective effects. To illuminate the issue, we recruited 17 PSIs and 15 non-interpreter bilinguals and compared behavioral and electrophysiological markers of word reading and translation from and into their native and non-native languages (L1 and L2, respectively). PSIs exhibited greater delta-theta (1–8 ​Hz) power across all tasks over varying topographies, but these were accompanied by faster performance only in the case of translation conditions. Moreover, neural differences in PSIs were most marked for L2-L1 translation (the dominant interpreting direction in their market), which exhibited maximally widespread modulations that selectively correlated with behavioral outcomes. Taken together, our results suggest that interpreting experience involves distinct neural signatures across reading and translation mechanisms, but that these are systematically related with processing efficiency only in domains that face elevated demands during everyday practice (i.e., L2-L1 translation). These findings can inform models of simultaneous interpreting, in particular, and expert cognitive processing, in general.","tags":[],"title":"Task-specific signatures in the expert brain: Differential correlates of translation and reading in professional interpreters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carla Pallavicini","Martina G Vilas","Mirta Villarreal","Federico Zamberlan","Suresh Muthukumaraswamy","David Nutt","Robin Carhart-Harris \u0026 Enzo Tagliazucchi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1571121733,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571121733,"objectID":"397db9f39c86102c7fdf436b5536158f","permalink":"https://martinagvilas.github.io/publication/spectral-signatures/","publishdate":"2019-10-15T08:42:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/spectral-signatures/","section":"publication","summary":"Classic serotonergic psychedelics are remarkable for their capacity to induce reversible alterations in consciousness of the self and the surroundings, mediated by agonism at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. The subjective effects elicited by dissociative drugs acting as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (e.g. ketamine and phencyclidine) overlap in certain domains with those of serotonergic psychedelics, suggesting some potential similarities in the brain activity patterns induced by both classes of drugs, despite different pharmacological mechanisms of action. We investigated source-localized magnetoencephalography recordings to determine the frequency-specific changes in oscillatory activity and long-range functional coupling that are common to two serotonergic compounds (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin) and the NMDA-antagonist ketamine. Administration of the three drugs resulted in widespread and broadband spectral power reductions. We established their similarity by using different pairs of compounds to train and subsequently evaluate multivariate machine learning classifiers. After applying the same methodology to functional connectivity values, we observed a pattern of occipital, parietal and frontal decreases in the low alpha and theta bands that were specific to LSD and psilocybin, as well as decreases in the low beta band common to the three drugs. Our results represent a first effort in the direction of quantifying the similarity of large-scale brain activity patterns induced by drugs of different mechanism of action, confirming the link between changes in theta and alpha oscillations and 5-HT2A agonism, while also revealing the decoupling of activity in the beta band as an effect shared between NMDA antagonists and 5-HT2A agonists. We discuss how these frequency-specific convergences and divergences in the power and functional connectivity of brain oscillations might relate to the overlapping subjective effects of serotonergic psychedelics and glutamatergic dissociative compounds.\n","tags":[],"title":"Spectral signatures of serotonergic psychedelics and glutamatergic dissociatives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Micaela Santilli","Martina G Vilas","Ezequiel Mikulan","Miguel Martorell Caro","Edinson Muñoz","Lucas Sedeño","Agustín Ibáñez \u0026 Adolfo M García"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1551469105,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551469105,"objectID":"4249d80cf1833fc76483a946ac2e6af9","permalink":"https://martinagvilas.github.io/publication/bilingualism/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T21:38:25+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bilingualism/","section":"publication","summary":"This study assessed whether bilingual memory is susceptible to the extreme processing demands of professional simultaneous interpreters (PSIs). Seventeen PSIs and 17 non-interpreter bilinguals completed word production, lexical retrieval, and verbal fluency tasks. PSIs exhibited enhanced fluency in their two languages, and they were faster to translate words in both directions. However, no significant differences emerged in picture naming or word reading. This suggests that lexical enhancements in PSIs are confined to their specifically trained abilities (vocabulary search, interlingual reformulation), with no concomitant changes in other word-processing mechanisms. Importantly, these differences seem to reflect specifically linguistic effects, as both samples were matched for relevant executive skills.

The quest to identify the neural correlates of consciousness combined psychophysical experimentation with neuroimaging tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the changes in neural activity associated with conscious vs. unconscious percepts. Different neuroimaging methods have also been applied to characterize spontaneous brain activity fluctuations during altered states of consciousness, and to develop quantitative metrics for the level of consciousness. Most of these studies, however, have not explored the dynamic nature of the whole-brain imaging data provided by fMRI. A series of empirical and computational studies strongly suggests that the temporal fluctuations observed in this data present a non-trivial structure, and that this structure is compatible with the exploration of a discrete repertoire of states. In this review we focus on how dynamic neuroimaging can be used to address theoretical accounts of consciousness based on the hypothesis of a dynamic core, i.e. a constantly evolving and transiently stable set of coordinated neurons that constitute an integrated and differentiated physical substrate for each conscious experience. We review work exploring the possibility that metastability in brain dynamics leads to a repertoire of dynamic core states, and discuss how it might be modified during altered states of consciousness. This discussion prompts us to review neuroimaging studies aimed to map the dynamic exploration of the repertoire of states as a function of consciousness. Complementary studies of the dynamic core hypothesis using perturbative methods are also discussed. Finally, we propose that a link between metastability in brain dynamics and the level of consciousness could pave the way towards a mechanistic understanding of altered states of consciousness using tools from dynamical systems theory and statistical physics.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic functional connectivity and brain metastability during altered states of consciousness","type":"publication"}]
